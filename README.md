# DevEx Scorecard Generator

A GitHub Bot that automatically generates Developer Experience (DevEx) Scorecards for repositories. The bot creates an issue with comprehensive criteria to evaluate how easy it is for developers to use and contribute to your project.

## Features

- **Automatic Issue Creation**: Creates a DevEx Scorecard issue when a repository is created or when the bot is installed
- **Interactive Checkbox**: Includes a "Re-run scorecard" checkbox that allows users to request a fresh analysis
- **Comprehensive Criteria**: Evaluates documentation, project structure, development setup, testing, CI/CD, security, and community aspects

## How It Works

1. **Installation**: When the bot is installed on a repository or when a new repository is created
2. **Issue Creation**: Automatically creates a "🎯 DevEx Scorecard" issue with evaluation criteria
3. **Re-run Feature**: Users can check the "Re-run scorecard" checkbox to trigger a fresh analysis
4. **Auto-update**: The bot automatically unchecks the box and adds a comment when re-run is completed

## Scorecard Criteria

The generated scorecard evaluates repositories across multiple dimensions:

- **📚 Documentation**: README, setup instructions, usage examples, contribution guidelines
- **🏗️ Project Structure**: File organization, naming conventions, separation of concerns
- **🔧 Development Setup**: Local development, dependency management, development scripts
- **🧪 Testing**: Unit tests, coverage reporting, integration tests
- **🚀 CI/CD**: Automated builds, testing, code quality checks
- **🔒 Security**: Security best practices, vulnerability scanning, secrets management
- **🤝 Community**: Issue templates, PR templates, code of conduct, license
