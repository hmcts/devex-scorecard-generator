## ScoreCard
Define Key Metrics and Best Practices
Decide which aspects of developer experience you want to measure (e.g., code quality, documentation, CI/CD usage, test coverage, onboarding speed, etc.).

Automate Data Collection
Write scripts or use tools to automatically gather data from repositories (e.g., GitHub API for repo stats, linters for code quality, coverage tools for tests).

Scorecard Generation Logic
Implement logic (in your app.py) that takes the collected metrics and calculates scores for each category. You can use weighted averages or custom formulas.

Output the Scorecard
Present the results in a readable formatâ€”Markdown, HTML, or even a dashboard. Include actionable recommendations for improvement.

Integrate with CI/CD
Make the scorecard generator runnable as part of your CI/CD pipeline so teams get feedback automatically.

Iterate and Customize
Allow teams to customize which metrics matter most to them and adjust scoring accordingly.
